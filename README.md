# Madlib Creator & Dictionary

Welcome to the Mad Lib Creator & Dictionary.  This CLI program is meant to be a fun way to explore words and definitions.  

## Installation

After you download or clone the github repository simply run `./bin/madlib` from the project directory.

## Usage

The user is presented with 4 options in the main menu.  There are three different Mad Libs they can explore or they can look up different words.  The user has the option while in the different Mad Libs to completely or partially fill out the Mad Lib with random words that fit the part of speech being requested.  One of the intended uses of this program is to take random words that a user isn't familiar with and to look them up using the program's definition feature.  Once the user is done they can type exit to end the program.
